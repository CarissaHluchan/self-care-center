# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The website I have built is designed to display affirmations or mantra messages based on a radio button selection. Upon selecting the receive message button the user is displayed a randomly selected message. The user can then decide whether or not they wish to keep that message from appearing a second time.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
There is no requirement that one has to clone the application. One can use an online version of this webpage by using the deployment.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am in Mod 1, week 3, at Turing and was given 5 days to complete the project.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of the project included gaining experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Learn to write HTML and CSS to match a provided composition. Understand how to listen to and respond to user events while individualizing my programming skill set.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
This was my first application in writing HTML and CSS. I had difficulty using and applying flex box declarations to align elements in the composition. After some iterations, I got the DOM to display as intended. Adding functionality to the data model proved challenging. I learned how to create an empty array and string to hold elements for the DOM display.
