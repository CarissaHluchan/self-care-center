### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The website I have built is designed to display affirmations or mantra messages based on a radio button selection. Upon selecting the receive message button the user is displayed a randomly selected message. The user can then decide whether or not they wish to keep that message from appearing a second time.

### Installation Instructions:

- Fork this project to your own Github account.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- cd into the project.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am a jounior dev in my 3rd week of a devloper boatcamp at Turing Sowaftware and Design. I Was given 5 days to complete the project.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
Built & deployed by [Carissa Hluchan](https://github.com/CarissaHluchan)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- HTML and CSS: This was my first application in writing HTML and CSS. 
- CSS flexbox: I used flex box declarations to align elements in the composition. After some iterations, I got the DOM to display as intended.
- Dom functions: Adding functionality to the data model proved challenging. I learned how to create an empty array and string to hold elements for the DOM display.
